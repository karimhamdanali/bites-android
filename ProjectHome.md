# Bites #

Bites is a cook book application. Recipes can be created on your phone, downloaded from the web and shared with friends via sms. Pick a recipe to make, tick off the ingredients you need, then add the ones you need to the shopping list in [Trolly](http://code.google.com/p/trolly/) or sms them to someone to pick up for you.

## Usage Scenario ##
You decide to make your famous fish curry for yourself, your partner and a couple of guests, so you grab your phone, open the fish curry recipe and tick the ingredients that you can't find in the cupboard. The ingredients that are ticked can now be added to a shopping list e.g. ([Trolly](http://code.google.com/p/trolly/))or sent via sms to your partner who is on the way home from work so they can pick them up.

## Sharing Recipes ##
Sharing recipes couldn't be easier with two simple options.
  * Simply select a recipe in Bites and send it to any other phone via sms. Phones with Bites installed will allow adding the recipe directly to the Bites database, but even phones without Bites receive the recipe as plain text.
  * Use your phone to download a Bites recipe file from any website (here are [some recipes to start with](http://sites.google.com/site/caldwellcode/Home/recipes)) to add it to your recipe book. See the RecipeFileFormat page for a recipe file template so you can start posting your own recipes.

**For usage and installation instructions see InstallationInstructions**
