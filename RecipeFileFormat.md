# Recipe Files #

Bites recipes are very simple .xml files.
Just create your file from the following template and post it on the web, then anyone with Bites on their phone can download and use your recipe. **Make sure you don't include any special characters (e.g. _&_) in your recipe text**

## Recipe File Template ##

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>

	<description>A short paragraph describing your recipe</description>
	<ingredient>Your first ingredient</ingredient>
	<ingredient>Your second ingredient</ingredient>
	<method step="1">Your first method step</method>

</recipe>
```

Simply replace the relevant fields and copy and paste as many ingredient and method rows as you need for your recipe. **Make sure you save your file with a .xml extension** then upload the file to your homepage or blog to share your recipe with the world!
